# AstroPowerBox

AstroPowerBox is a simple, modern power manager for your telescopes and accessories.

It is based on ESP32 processors, and provides  web interface for reading power statistics, and configuring PWM outputs.
It also reads both ambient temperature/humidity and on scope temperature probes, so it can dynamically regulate the temperature of dew heaters attached to your telescopes.
